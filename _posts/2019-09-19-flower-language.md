Having a hard time pulling in the SU? Need a new approach to end those lonely Wednesday nights? Maybe you just really like flowers.  Well we have the solution for you: Victorian Flower Language. Who knew so much could be expressed through the arrangement of flowers? Finally, you can hide your shallow personality and crippling VK addiction behind a beautiful bouquet.

There are so many combinations of flowers and arrangements that no one could ever find all the combinations that could land you a catch in the SU, but here at the Dab we have too much free time so here are our top picks:

### Basic Bish

The china rose is a good go to. Its traditional meaning is that of being always beautiful no matter what you're doing or wearing. Perfect for that 3am last ditch attempt when everyone looks like they've been dragged through a hedge backwards at least twice.

But what about if they're not beautiful no matter what but you still want to seem nice? That's where the clematis comes into play.

This is a flower that represents inner beauty and intelligence (two attributes that are known how well they come across in a club). 

The Honey Flower is a flower of secret and forbidden love.

Maybe you're avoiding the heckles of your friends of just prefer to remain discreet. Whatever your reason, you can be sure that this flower will definitely not draw attention to you as you present it to the love of your night.

### Getting Steamy
Not getting the responses you were expecting, perhaps they are into your flower displays but just don't know they have to respond.

Jonquils (pretty sure these are just daffodils but whatever...) are the way to go. These signal that you want a return of affection and not just a worried stare. 

What if you think you will actually die if you don't see them again? Well, there is a plant for you.

_I honestly don't know what is going on with this drawing..._

The laurestina means "I die if neglected". Take that as you will but I feel like it may invoke at least a response out of your new found love of your life.

### Help I've Gone Too Far

But what if this flower based flirting has been too successful? Well this is where you can play you final flower based hand: Basil.

Basil is the flower (hmmm) of hatred. Maybe a little strong for some cases but when they really aren't getting the message (maybe because you're talking to them with flowers), it may take a flash of the ol' basil to send them on their way. Maybe the basil is too harse for your smooth ways though. That's where the striped carnation comes into play.

This flower means that you can't be with them but don't disclose the reason. Perfect for ditching someone without crushing their already delicate (because it was built with flowers by you) ego.

That just about sums up everything I can be bothered to write about flowers. Hopefully you can use this to some advantage but to be honest I pulled most of this out my arse so gl. Please like and subscribe.
