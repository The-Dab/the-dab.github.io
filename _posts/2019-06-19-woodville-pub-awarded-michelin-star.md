In a shocking decision by the world renowned Michelin guide, the iconic pub on Woodville Road locally referred to as the “Woody” has been awarded one of the highest awards in culinary excellence. In an interview with The Dab, the current owner and co founder Melvin Woodman commented that he was “quite happy” with the honour as he fell into a wing Wednesday induced coma. Upon further questioning he remained silent. A star from the Michelin Guide is usually reserved for well established restaurants and eateries that provide a uniquely exceptional experience so it is in no doubt that regulars to the pub were stupefied. When asked for comment, a man in very tight shorts gave the following statement:

“I have been coming to the Woody for the last three years and I would have never expected this pub to be presented such a prestigious award. Personally, I think the Mack would have been better suited to the award as their wings are marginally cheaper which makes all the difference.”

This is not the first time the spotlight of fame has been cast upon the Woodville however. Earlier this year, the pub was awarded a food hygiene rating of 4, the highest ever awarded to a business in Cathays.
