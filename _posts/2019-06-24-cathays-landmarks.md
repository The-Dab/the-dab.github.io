The tales that this neighbourhood we call Cathays holds are many. They are tales of intrigue, tales of mystery, tales of love gained, and love lost. While the tales Cathays holds are interesting, they are too plentiful, dear reader, to detail to you fully in this article alone. To get a full sense of the majesty of the place one must not simply read about it, but become a part of it, immerse themselves in its grandeur. As you move on your magical journey through life, you will have much time to further explore this neighbourhood’s lore, but for the time being, let me indulge you if I may, with just a hint of the history this place has as I take you on a journey through the origins of the names of some of its many landmarks…

## The Woodville

The Woodville is currently owned and operated by Michelin Star recipient Melvin Woodman, whose family name, is the namesake of the pub. But the origin of this pub goes much deeper than just this individual. The Woodville Pub was opened by royal charter in 1531 by Henry VIII and its ownership was transferred to his personal tree surgeon Boniface Woodman. Boniface Woodman had recently completed trimming back the king’s willow tree at Hampton Court as it was starting to grow into his neighbour’s garden and he was worried that she would get angry and call the council. As a gesture of thanks for this, Henry VIII gifted this pub to Boniface who was allowed to name it. After finding out that “The Woodman” was already taken and thinking that “The Woodman123” didn’t sound too great, Boniface settled on the name we all know and love today. The Woodville has been passed down to members of the Woodman family ever since and stands as a symbol of pride for tree surgeons everywhere.

## Family Fish Bar

Before it became the beacon of shimmering light in the great enveloping darkness of 3am on Salisbury Road for drunk students everywhere, Family Fish Bar was what the name implies, a bar. But not a bar where you can order drinks, no, the bar. Yes, Fam Fish was once a small court in which the people of Cathays were tried for a number of offences. One particularly notable trial was that of Miller family, who in 1891, stood accused of double homicide. The alleged murderers’ weapon of choice was a dead trout. The “Family Fishers” as they were referred to at the time were found guilty and sentenced to death. Shortly after this high-profile case, Cathays locals took to calling the court the Family Fishers’ Bar. This name was eventually shortened to just Family Fish Bar only a few years before the courthouse closed and was turned into a fish and chips shop.

## CPS Homes

The acronym CPS stands for Crap Property Service and is a reference to the fact that CPS is a shit letting agency.

## Cathays itself!

Have you ever wondered why it’s called Cathays? In the early 11th century the area was owned by a woman named Cathy. When people went to visit her, they would tell their friends that they were going to Cathy’s. The name was still in use approximately 200 years later when a vote was held to add a letter to the name. It is unknown why the residents of Cathays wanted to add another letter to their name, some reports from the time mention there being a general feeling of wanting to “spice things up a bit” but historians have failed to verify these claims. Nevertheless, a vote was held in which every letter of the alphabet was a contender. The vote was of course won by “a”, presumably because most people in the 13th century couldn’t read and so they just voted for the letter that was at the top of the list. As time went on, people began butchering the original pronunciation of the name, as people tend to do, until we ended up with the pronunciation we have today. So the next time you’re making fun of a new fresher for pronouncing it CA-THEYS, just remember that they may not actually be doing it accidentally, they may in fact just refuse to acknowledge the outcome of a 13th century vote.

## The Student’s Union

The Cardiff University Student’s Union has that name because of the fact that it is a place where the students of Cardiff University like to go.
