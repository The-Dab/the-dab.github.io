Here at the Dab, we've done the research for the best Freshers' night out so you don't need to! We have juicy lineup of the top events this freshers including one that you won't believe exists!?

# Cardiff Met SU

When Cardiff SU just isn't enough. Join the true heros in the wildest night of the century. It's the only club in the city where you can get a sports massage and never have to queue for the bar. Why? Because there's fuck all people there.

# Fam Fish Hidden Bar

It is said that if you utter the magic words, touch the right photos on the wall, and then pass out in exactly the right spot, you will awaken in one of the most exclusive hidden bars in Wales. If greasy dance floors and potato fritters are for you, then this is the place to come.

# Iselder Llethol

For when Welsh Club won't hide the tears.

# Can't really remember this one

I'm really scraping the barrel with this one so please help me out and just gloss over this night.

# Live Lounge

Imagine a club with cheesy bangers, free entry everyday, live music everyday, dangerously cheap shots, don't forget the house wine, and some of the best company you can find (and pizza slices). Well what if we told you this place is real? Well this place definitely isn't real. If you hear of a place called Live Lounge and you're a first year, stay away. _please_
