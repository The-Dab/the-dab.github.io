I must begin by stating that live lounge is in fact not a club, but a lounge. I know this because it is the name. Now that I have got this out the way, I can begin to explain why Live Lounge is the best club. It all begins with a tequila shot. Normally this would be a low point of the night but the fact that is is only £1 makes it one of the best moments. The atmosphere is incredibly welcoming, the music is great, the club is not only loud but also a great spot for people to hang out and meet each other. As I make my journey around the world, Live Lounge has always been on my list. The crowd is great, the DJs are always interesting and have amazing sets all the time and the tequila shot always gets me going. It's an experience I wish every club had to offer. The music is incredible and the club is in the centre of Cardiff.

I wish every club around the world had Live Lounge as this is why I love travelling and travelling the world. Check out the latest live music in your favourite country on Spotify or Facebook.

I also wish every club had these live DJs every week, when I'm having beers with my friends on the patio of my suite or going clubbing at the beach. It's a fantastic way to share drinks, dance and live music. The live DJs are also available for private events and you can play your tunes with them in different languages. They're so talented and they make amazing dancing partners.

Live Lounge's sound is amazing. Even the songs are great when it's live, but there is nothing on this list when it's done right! No need for live DJ tricks.

The sound system is very good for those who want their music on all the time. It does not sound so good when you mix it down, as it is so distorted you won't hear anything. My own setup consists of two amps and a 3×3 surround system, so I never have to worry about noise or sound system issues while DJing or practicing on the deck.

A perfect live event for me would have all live DJs in one room. With the sound quality being so good, I would be able to just turn it up and start dancing. For live events these are my favourite:
1. Krewella.
This British band is a great surprise for me in 2017. They have the perfect combination of sound and style to make this list. Krewella has always seemed so natural and authentic. I love the way they sound whenever they play, even if it's a few weeks out of the way of a radio stream.

5. Dej Loaf. 
I absolutely love the sound emanating from their instruments; they are so clean, crisp, and yet so soulful. I know nothing about Dej Loaf, and I love that they love to experiment a lot. I am glad they do in their music.

6. Tame Impala. 
It takes a special kind of person to like and enjoy Tame Impala. They don't try to be the next big thing or to sound cool. They just focus on the sound
